## General Information

Based on [@3chospirits](https://github.com/3chospirits) Discord music bot [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN29HIaoHLU&ab_channel=Niconiconii). I wanted to create a music bot with simple functionality for a private server that could fit the needs of those in it, all without using an established bot.

The bot functions as intended with some room for improvement in the next version.

## Technologies Used

- Discord-Player v5.3.2
- Node v18+

## Features

Audio streaming from Youtube in a private Discord channel


## Project Status
